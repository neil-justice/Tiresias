    <h1>Web Tech Project Interim Report</h1>
    <p>This is our interim report for our prediction tracking website.</p>
    <h3>Website</h3>
    <p>Our website aims to track predictions and claims made for the future, ranging from promises made by politicians, to a simple bet made between two friends. It gives users the chance to track predictions made within the categories that interest them, vote on whether they think the prediction will come true, see success/failure stats for categories, users and popular figures, and add their own claims to the site should they wish to have a public record of it.</p>
    <h3>Prediction Page</h3>
    <p>The biggest chunk of our effort has gone towards making the prediction page. This page will include information about a single prediction, including its title, description, a link to the source, a map showing the area(s) affected, a timer/progress bar showing the time left, tags, comments, stats, and it will give the users the ability to upvote/downvote a prediction. <br/>
    Currently, we have all the features with the exception of the comments and the stats, complete with CSS styling and a script to set the navigation bar item positioning (in case we ever need to change it).<br/>
    Our 'New Prediction' button also uses JavaScript to inject a modal window containing a form into the page. This form doesn't submit data yet.<br/>
    The login button injects a login form which slides down at the top of the page.  Clicking the button again submits the username and password.</p>
    <h3>Homepage</h3>
    <p>We've also started work on a home page, which for now will be a list of 10 or so predictions, ordered by most recent (though it could have other options). We thought that this would be a good place to learn and test Angular, and make use of its templating, loop constructs and its ability to dynamically update the page, giving our web page a modern feel while also making it easy to provide such interactivity.</p>
    <p>We have made a start on the server-side as part of the experiments with the home page, and we have managed to get Angular communicating with Express, which then accesses a MongoDB database in order to fetch a dummy list of predictions, and display them on the homepage. </p>
